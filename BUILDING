KenLM has switched to cmake
  cmake .

If you only want the query code and do not care about compression (.gz, .bz2, and .xz):
  ./compile_query_only.sh

Windows:
  The windows directory has visual studio files.  Note that you need to compile
  the kenlm project before build_binary and ngram_query projects.
